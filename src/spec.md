# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Set up the initial Concept Delta platform structure with routing, branding, and basic UI components.

**Planned changes:**
- Create routing structure with six pages: Home (/), Dashboard (/dashboard), Admin (/admin), About (/about), Test (/test/:id), and Result (/result/:id)
- Implement responsive Navbar with Delta logo, "Concept Delta" text, navigation links (Home, About, Login placeholder), and mobile hamburger menu
- Establish color scheme using Primary Navy (#1e3a8a), Light Blue Accent (#60a5fa), and white backgrounds
- Create reusable gradient button component (navy to light blue)
- Implement Footer with "Concept Delta © 2026", "COEPian Initiative" text, and YouTube/Telegram placeholders
- Build Hero Section on Home page with heading "practice MHT-CET with real exam level mock tests", subtext "Free practice tests designed by COEPians", and "Start Free Test" CTA button

**User-visible outcome:** Users can navigate through a branded multi-page platform structure with a clean, minimal design featuring the Concept Delta identity and a compelling home page hero section promoting MHT-CET practice tests.
