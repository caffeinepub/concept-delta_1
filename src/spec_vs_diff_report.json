  "summary": "All three requirements (REQ-18, REQ-19, REQ-20) are fully implemented in the Admin.tsx component. The implementation correctly uses useAuth hook to access isAuthenticated and role, implements useEffect-based navigation for both unauthenticated users (redirect to /) and non-admin users (redirect to /dashboard), and prevents content rendering before redirects. No missing requirements or hallucinated features detected.",
