  "summary": "The diff implements all 8 requirements from the BuildRequest. Frontend changes include validation for classLevel (11th/12th), subject (Physics/Chemistry/Maths), and chapter fields in Admin.tsx, with form submission blocking and error messages. The image-only workflow is preserved by keeping questionText and option fields optional. Backend deleteQuestion in main.mo properly handles Nat ID matching and returns Bool. QuestionGallery.tsx implements delete functionality with success/error messages and automatic refresh via React Query cache invalidation.",

      "reason": "REQ-85 states that images can be used without text, implying images remain optional. The BuildRequest does not require making question images mandatory, yet the validateForm function in Admin.tsx includes if (!questionImage) { errors.general = \"Question image is required\"; }, forcing image uploads.",

The diff shows only classLevel, subject, chapter, questionImage, correctAnswer, and marks fields remain in the form state and UI, but questionText and option A/B/C/D text fields appear to be completely removed rather than kept as optional fields.",
