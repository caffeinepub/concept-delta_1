  "summary": "The diff implements most of the chapter-wise test creation system requirements. A new 'Create Test' tab and form were added to the Admin panel with all required fields (test name, class level, subject, duration, marks per question). The backend includes Test type definition, createTest() and updateTestStatus() functions in main.mo. The frontend includes question filtering, selectable question list with thumbnails, selected question counter, form validation, and hooks for test creation and status updates. However, the Publish toggle button (REQ-79) appears to be missing from the UI implementation, though the backend function exists.",

      "requirement": "Add a Publish toggle button to the Create Test form that changes a test's status from 'draft' to 'published' by calling the backend updateTestStatus() function",
      "reason": "The CreateTest.tsx file was truncated, but no evidence of a Publish toggle button implementation is visible in the available portion. The updateTestStatus hook exists in useQueries.ts and the backend function exists, but the UI button to trigger it is not evident in the truncated CreateTest.tsx content.",
